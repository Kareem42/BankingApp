Java Developer Skills Test — Console Banking Application

Objective
Build a small Java console-based banking application that demonstrates practical use of the four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming:

* Abstraction
* Encapsulation
* Inheritance
* Polymorphism

Your implementation should follow clean code principles and be runnable entirely from the console.

✅ Functional Requirements:
Account Types
The system must support two types of bank accounts:
* Checking Account
* Savings Account

Each account must have:
* Account number
* Owner name
* Balance

Basic Banking Operations

The user must be able to:
* Deposit money
* Withdraw money
* Check account balance
* Switch between accounts

Validation rules:

* Deposit amount must be greater than zero
* Withdrawal amount must be greater than zero
* Cannot withdraw more than current balance
* Savings account must enforce a withdrawal limit of $300 per transaction

Console Menu
Provide a simple text-based menu allowing the user to:

* Switch account
* Make a deposit
* Make a withdrawal
* Check balance
* Exit program
* Loop until the user chooses to exit.

🎯 OOP Requirements (Mandatory)
Abstraction

* You must use an abstract class named Account that defines:
* Common fields (account number, owner, balance)
* A deposit() method (implemented in base class)
* An abstract withdraw() method (implemented in subclasses)

Encapsulation

* All fields in the Account class must be private or protected
* Provide getters/setters only when appropriate
* Balance may be protected if you want subclasses to access it directly

Inheritance

* The classes CheckingAccount and SavingsAccount must both extend the abstract Account class

Polymorphism

* withdraw(double amount) must behave differently for each account type
* The main program must treat accounts polymorphically, e.g.:

Account activeAccount = new CheckingAccount(...);


Switching accounts should simply switch the reference but continue using the Account type.

🧩 Technical Requirements

* Must be written in Java 8+
* No external libraries (only standard Java)
* Use clean, readable code structure
* Use correct OOP principles (not just "syntactically correct classes")
* Application should run from a single main() method
